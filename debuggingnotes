convertAnother:43 TreeMarshaller iterates through a satellite tracker script. the satellites facing is nan. why.

this would explain why not adding the script would remove the error, because then it wouldnt be iterated through

also explains why not making satllites fixed it since facing wasnt nan

orbit of the satellites is nan. same for currangle

the thrown exception in the script's updateSatelliteStatus method is called very early into planetgen

regenerateorbitspacing does not fix NaN facings

most of the NaNs are from things like gas giants in nebulae; these dont orbit. what if that lack of orbitting is what causes it
