need to consdier getting rid of the satellite tracker everyframe

idea 1: invisible uninteractable fleet. i like this one the most because it works exactly the way other things wrok i hope, but hartley dislikes it
2. station. probably wont work
3. just directly inject the satellites into battles that happen near the planet. maybe? need to use a listener for this

can make fleets untargettable with MemFlags.FLEET_IGNORED_BY_OTHER_FLEETS
