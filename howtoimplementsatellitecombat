need to consdier getting rid of the satellite tracker everyframe

idea 1: invisible uninteractable fleet. i like this one the most because it works exactly the way other things wrok i hope, but hartley dislikes it
2. station. probably wont work
3. just directly inject the satellites into battles that happen near the planet. maybe? need to use a listener for this

can make fleets untargettable with MemFlags.FLEET_IGNORED_BY_OTHER_FLEETS

for some reason a derelict lfeet isnt joining the battle due to wantsToJoin in tacticalmodule, im blaming line 1317 or something?
the tactical module isnt standing down, not trade fleet, the battleside isnt NO_JOIN,

isStandingDown, in tacticalmodule, only returns true if:
the ai's assignment module does NOT have a null assignment

it is getting to checking the cr of each ship in its fleet

IT IS HASENOUGHSTUFFAROUND

var2 is .67f, var4 is always false

also, satellites dont join combat because pickside returns NO_JOIN fucking lord i hate my life
