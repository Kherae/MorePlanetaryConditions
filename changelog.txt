3.0.0:
INCOMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS SAVES
Update to Starsector 0.96a-RC10

New condition: Overgrown Nanoforge:
    A old abandoned industial nanoforge, endlessly expanding in a grey-goo scenario. 
Adds industry: Overgrown Nanoforge
    Has a inherent costless and demandless output of goods
    Will continuously generate structures that augment it's stats
        Ex. A structure that increases the industry's supply output by 3, but increases upkeep by 2000 credits.
        A structure that increases accessibility, but lowers fuel output by 1.
    These structures do not instantly deconstruct, and the process of creation cannot be instantly stopped
        It takes time and money to do so
    Prior to construction, the effects of the structures become progressively more known as it nears the end
        Encourages you to make early judgements on if you want to start destroying it before it's made, at less cost
    
    The main industry is only destroyable once all connected structures are destroyed
        Once destroyed, you receive a unique nanoforge item that massively increases commodity output of any structure it's inserted into,
        but has various negative effects
        If installed in heavy industry, increases faction-wide fleet size by 400% but reduces ship quality by 400% as well
    
    This encourages you to treat this as a sort of bonsai tree, constantly minmaxing the effects, minimizing negatives, maximizing positives
    Extremely rare - only 1-2 if any will spawn in a given game

Anti-Asteroid Satellites:

Ships
    Overclocked targetting (Frontal plate system) now 1. Overloads for far longer 2. Lasts for far less
    Harpoon MRM small removed from most variants, as it was way too spammy
    Variants
        Ordnance
            Replaced annihilator pods with jackhammer/typhoon respectively
            Variant weight drastically reduced
        Beamer
            Replaced most missiles with DEMs
            Variant weight moderately reduced
        Shielded
            Connector module Locust replaced with hellbore to reduce spam
            Variant weight slightly reduced
    Core
        Do not fire through added - modules will no longer fire through the core, enhancing flank capabilities
        Weapons adjusted in general
        All weapons either now have secondary or primary PD capabilties
            PD_ALSO and PD tags respectively
        Max recoil of weapons reduced to 10%
            Sounds like a buff, but is actually a fat nerf as it makes it way easier to dodge projectiles

2.1.1a:
SAVE COMPATABLE
SOme misc balance changes, such as reducing the time the superheavy damper is active for, increasing targetting overclock cooldown, switching the ordnance locust to a hurricane

2.1.1:
SAVE COMPATABLE

Satellites significantly buffed: Heavy combat modules now have the system "Overclocked Targetting", which multiples weapon range by a factor of 100 for ~10 seconds, before overloading the module for 10 seconds. Has custom AI so that it doesn't activate when it's fighting a nearby ship. The satellites were a little sucky at their role as a long-ranged artillery platform, and this will significantly alleviate that flaw.
Core given "Superheavy damper field", a damepr field that reduces damage taken by 90% but only lasts for 2.5 seconds, has a 1 second cooldown, has 2 charges, and takes a while to recharge. The intent is to give cores a small amount of survivability against strike attacks, so you cant just rush in and burst it down. You're forced to at least hit it for 2.5 seconds, and at worst, 6 full seconds.
Heavy combat modules have been given armored weapon mounts.
Their beams are now modded weapons, that have instant travel time. This makes the beamer varient scary.
Raised DP/FP to 60.
Swarm variant is more common and now is composed almost entirely out of wasps. https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/Smileys/default/smiley.gif

Misc. cleanup

2.1.0a
Removes magiclib dependency

2.1.0
MAYBE SAVE COMPATABLE I DONT REMEMBER
Makes satellites work a bit more consistantly
Raesvelg now starts with satellites (You can generate satellites on planets via the config)
Hopefully fixed an edge case crash

2.0.0
NOT SAVE COMPATBLE
Massively refactors most of the mod
Fixed a few critical bugs
Fixed a few misc bugs
Changed some satellite stats
Game should be significantly more stable

1.0.5a
LIKELY SAVE COMPATABLE

Fixes up a few things from the last updates and polishes it

1.0.5

HOPEFULLY SAVE COMPATBLE

Laid very initial groundwork for next condition
Made a workaround for a bug that caused a crash when a game was loaded

1.0.4
INCOMPATABLE WITH PREVIOUS SAVES

Added a few config options for discovering every satellite at once
Added a stopgap for the satellite fleet drift issue by forcing the satellite fleet on fleets interacting with the planet to orbit the planet
Improved station digging code so that it almost always finds the satellite entity and returns important data, even if the entity we interact with isnt a station
Added a lot more debug code that should hopefully catch and resolve scenarios where entity is null apon application of the satellite condition
Improved code for fighting your own faction's satellites to use a better method
Increased satellite sensor profile to 3 from 1

Backend:
Documented campaignplugin heavily
Misc documentation and annotations
Misc nullchecks
Misc naming improvements
Deleted unneccessary files, renamed a few to be more descriptive and accurate

1.0.3
Added a few config options for enabling/disabling a few features
Reworked some of the backend
Satellites now always defend markets and stations if you interact with them
Upgraded debugging
More station compatibility

1.0.2
Fixed NPE on fighting station markets

1.0.1
Fixed NPE on simulation
Removed weapons from the game, they were unused
Added tips
Satellites can no longer turn
Most likely save compatable? Probably?

1.0.0

Release
Satellites no longer spawn in core worlds.
Fixed up some combat AI.
Polished some things
Fixed the console command

1.1.0_beta:

Added a new console command, FindPlanetsWithConditionId (conditionId). Lists all planets in the game with a given condition. Syntax: FindPlanetsWithConditionId (conditionId)

1.0.0_beta:

Finishing up the beta stage. All major bugs seem to have vanished and functionality has never been better.
Added a new very rare swarm variant. This one will kick your ass.

0.0.6_beta:
Adds a bunch of questionably balanced variants. Fixes a few bugs. Reduces satellite DP to one to hopefully let their allies deploy more ships.

0.0.5_beta:
Reworked a lot of the backend. Improved a lot of ***, although in a way that makes me unhappy.

Next update will probably be a huge quality pass.

0.0.4_beta:
Fixed a few crashes.

Improved polish further.
Buffed satellites FP.
Buffed satellite range.
Nearly perfects fleet interception.

More misc changes. All in all, its way more playable now.

0.0.3_beta:
Fixed a few crashes.
Improved the functionality of hostile fleet interception. It now works. Somewhat.

You can now fight your own colony's satellites.
Improved the description of the condition.
Added illustrations that arent placeholders.

Misc polish and ***.

0.0.2_beta:
Fixed a NPE when loading saves. Hopefully.

Please tell me if you get any strange crashes at random, I found a possible hole in the logic of my design (I am assuming many variables will not be null, they may be).

0.0.1_beta:
Satellite balance: Nerfed the range of the satellites, reduced the number of the satellites, reduced the amount of harpoons on the heavy combat modules, reduced the health/armor of the heavy combat modules. Satellites now start at 70% CR.

New features: Untested framework for fleets being attacked by satellites if the fleets want to attack the planet.

New description for satellites. New sprite for satellites in orbit of entities.
Cleaned up some backend code.

Many more misc changes I won't be assed to document until release.

0.0.0_beta:
Beta release
