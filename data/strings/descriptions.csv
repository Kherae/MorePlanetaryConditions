niko_MPC_defenseSatellite,CUSTOM,"A domain-era derelict anti-asteroid satellite, presumably placed in orbit to defend against stellar debris from falling onto the planet below.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteBarrage,TERRAIN,"An array of defense satellites constantly watch over this area, showering anything they deem a threat with a hail of long-ranged artillery.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteCore,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

When exploratorium drones discover a planet, they often perform rudimentary terraforming to better increase it's chances of becoming a viable planet for the ever-growing domain. One such terraform is to prevent any space debris from falling down to earth, and these satellites are one such way of doing it. Armed to the teeth with anti-asteroid, anti-scrap, and, some may argue, anti-ship weaponry, these quite intimidating orbital bastions dominate the orbit of whatever planet they orbit, preventing any unidentified and unauthorized matter from erronously entering their sphere of influence. 

Between those that were aware of the existance of these satellite prior to the collapse, there was often a hushed whisper and quiet idea that these satellites were built for more than just point-defense duty, rationalizing this obvious nonsense - at least, that's what domain ComSec portrayed it as - with the unusual amount of heavy weaponry and layered armor for something of it's nature.
Between those that are aware of their existance now - There is a very common agreement that these things are terribly annoying, intimidating, and lucrative to control.",,,

MPC_omega_derelict_mothership,SHIP,"One of the legendary survey motherships, the quiet automated workhorse of the Domain exploration and colonization effort. This is in essence a von Neumann probe, as the survey motherships contain autoforge capacity to manufacture a suite of smaller survey ships and the supplies required to perform its ongoing mission. This specimen is burned and battered by its centuries of service to the Domain, a drifting forgotten hulk.

A fearsome intelligance has taken control over this instrument of science. Its weapon mounts have been upgraded, a large shield generator has been installed (of unknown make), and its hull has been reinforced by neutronium armor. Truely, a fearsome opponent.",,,

MPC_atlas2_kanta,SHIP,"Previously owned by a fierce pirate warlord, this once sub-par ""capital"" ship has been extensively modified to transform it into a terrifying vehicle of war, capable of glassing a small colony through firepower alone.

The Atlas-class superfreighter is a prime target of pirate attacks. A few are later found at the broken heart of a sharp spray of impact debris in some lonely orbit. Others earn a pirate's second appraising glance and are hauled off to secret shipyards. Cargo holds are ripped apart, replaced with trusses to hold weapons mounts and souped-up ammo feed lines.

This Atlas, reborn in vacuum and fire, now delivers a cargo of death from the hand of a pirate warlord.",,,

MPC_superheavyDamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"An ancient design of the damper field that was discontinued due to the fact that it was extremely inefficient and had to shut down engines to prevent interference. 

Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",Defensive,"Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",
MPC_overclockedTargetting,SHIP_SYSTEM,,Offensive,"Massively increases weapon range, to near-infinite levels.",
MPC_overclockedTargettingCore,SHIP_SYSTEM,,Offensive,"Massively increases weapon range, to near-infinite levels.",
MPC_acceleratedOrdnanceFeeder,SHIP_SYSTEM,Activates a highly advanced - but jamming-prone - mechanism for quickly delivering all forms of ordnance to on-board weapons. The mechanism must be re-calibrated and cooled before it can be used again.,Offensive,Provides a flux cost reduction and a brief but massive boost to the rate of fire of all weapons.,
,,,,,
MPC_realspaceHyperspace_deep,TERRAIN,"This volume of hyperspace is particularly chaotic, hindering the performance of even hyperspace-calibrated equipment.",,,
MPC_realspaceHyperspace_storm,TERRAIN,"This volume of hyperspace is undergoing chaotic phase shifts leading to wildly fluctuating resonance cascades. Ancient and dire warnings of prolonged exposure to so-called ""hyperspace storms"" have been passed down through generations of spacers.",,,
MPC_magnetic_field_hyper,TERRAIN,"An extremely strong magnetic field which traps high energy charged particles. It's extremely difficult to get any sensor readings on a fleet lurking within, and often impossible, due to the frequency of ion storms.",,,
MPC_mesonField,TERRAIN,"A thick field of meson particles. Due to their signature enhancing nature, it's very easy to get a clear sensor reading on a fleet passing through. The effect is inverted, however, once meson concentration surpasses the Burivil threshold, and instead fleets lurking within find their sensors massively amplified and their own signature hidden.",,,
MPC_magnetarField,TERRAIN,"Naturally produced by magnetars, these magnetic fields are unfathomobly strong, capable of shredding atoms into quark cylinders. Thankfully, if one keeps their distance, they can usually avoid the worst - but magnetars typically make that difficult.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_devilRocketPod,WEAPON,"The devil-class torpedo combines the destructive power of the famous reaper with a long-distance ion thruster, creating a terrifyingly effective cruise missile capable of striking targets from across the battlefield with 50 MJ of explosive force. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

The devil-class torpedo consists of two parts: An ion thruster block, and the payload. The payload is rather uninteresting - merely a downsized reaper-class torpedo fitted on a thin frame. The ion block, though, is a rather fascinating piece of technology. Instead of chemical propellant, it ionizes miniscule amounts of gas to travel at impressive speeds, removing the need for a bulky fuel tank. Unfortunately, it was considered impractical for its intended use as a starship thruster due to the prohibitive costs associated with installing one - to say nothing of the flux costs, which paradoxically makes their performance worse than chemical thrusters due to the zero-flux boost.

Early testing showed promise in long-ranged ordnance, but the “Decisive Battle” naval doctrine the domain fielded prevented its adoption outside of specialized cases. A specialized case appeared with the advent of the Outguard-class defense satellite, and the lack of properly long-ranged missiles soon became evident. Thus, the devil was born, with the express purpose of intercepting fast-moving asteroids at long-range before they impact the satellite’s protectorate.
",,,
MPC_pinprickPod,WEAPON,"With a fuel-to-weight ratio of 90%, the pinprick can travel for hundreds of kilometers without even flaming out. Its utility is limited by the utter lack of payload, made even worse by its flathead design. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

Created for the same reason as the devil-class torpedo, the pinprick is a long-ranged support missile. Its strange characteristics are explained by its intended role - to strike asteroids into pieces small enough for any atmosphere to burn them up.

Unlike its cousin, the pinprick uses conventional propulsion instead of an ion thruster, enabling it to be mounted far more easily, and with no flux cost.

MPC_coronaResistStation,CUSTOM,"A potentially abandoned research station, built either to study some interesting local phenomenon or to study that which is best kept far, far away from inhabited worlds. Its oddity is immediately noticable - the ionized beam of the nearby pulsar curves around the station as if repelled by an invisible force, and sensor sweeps show clear signs of activity both inside and outside the station.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_baryonEmitterStandard,CUSTOM,"Portable baryon emitters such as this one are useful for supporting attacking fleets during a military action such as a raid. One quickly realizes why they were typically built on planets - the potential output, without a massive power district, is middling at best, and can only partially protect a fleet from the dangers of space. 

These pre-collapse emitters are considered both a rarity and a sad reminder of what we lost, as no current faction has found the DRM needed to produce one - and the cost of such construction would be prohibitive.
",,,
MPC_baryonEmitterPostcollapse,CUSTOM,"Portable baryon emitters such as this one are useful for supporting attacking fleets during a military action such as a raid. One quickly realizes why they were typically built on planets - the potential output, without a massive power district, is middling at best, and can only partially protect a fleet from the dangers of space. 

Constructed using a recovered fac-chip and smartly substituted resources, this emitter is not only incredibly cheaper than the propietary ErugNostic units, but significantly more effective - though still inferior in comparison to a planet-based emitter. This piece of machinery is proof that, despite everything, we can recover what we've lost.

MPC_star_blackDwarf,PLANET,"Once considered theoretical, a black dwarf is the final stage of life for any main sequence star. After exhausting all fusable material, white dwarves cease to output any significant light or energy, leaving behind a scorching-hot mass of degenerate matter, slowly cooling into an inert ball of stable metal.

Domain scientists reacted to the discovery of black dwarves in the sector with a mixture of intrigue and fright - on one hand, it allows for a new perspective on astrophysics and cosmo-chronology. On the other hand, it implies our universe my be aging faster than we anticipated.
",,,
MPC_star_magnetar,PLANET,"A variant of a neutron star, magnetars are the most magnetically powerful entities in the known universe, with a field strong enough to rip even non-ferric material apart on a molecular level. Conventional physics break down on its surface, as atoms are deformed into quark cylinders, possibly even forming strange matter.

While the Domain was happy to visit pulsars and even singularities with their survey drones, every single known instance of a magnetar was given a black mark in the exploratorium record, owing to their unique ability to destroy drive fields. Whether it's a pulse or stream magnetar, the sheer energy contained in their output is enough to leave a fleet helpless for days or even weeks - that is, if they don't fall victim to the evercalling magnetic pull of the star. Every spacer has the same advice - stay away, for death awaits you.",,,
MPC_gasGiantIntrastellarCapture,PLANET,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star.

This gas giant resides past the ""frost line"" of the nearby star, where normal gas giants rarely, if ever, form. While carefree minds quickly jump to conspiracy theory, your scientists are pretty sure this is just an interstellar capture.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_magnetarBeacon,CUSTOM,"A fully autonomous warning beacon. Contains a solid-state power system which enables theoretical operation and station-keeping half-life with an upwards range in the hundreds of thousands of cycles. This one is not doing so well - it's pulses are faint, and inconsistantly timed. Something is clearly wrong with it.

The astute starship captain will heed well its warning... if it still has one to give.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_magnetarShield,CUSTOM,"Little more than a slab of metal with stabilizing boosters attached, it appears to have been placed here to provide mobile cover for fleets operating in this system. Hiding behind it should shield you from the magnetar's pulses.

Your fleet's autonav can automatically position your fleet in the optimal shelter position - you just need to set a course.",,,

MPC_magnetarShield_hijacked,CUSTOM,"Little more than a slab of metal with stabilizing boosters attached, it appears to have been placed here to provide mobile cover for fleets operating in this system. Hiding behind it should shield you from the magnetar's pulses.

Your fleet's autonav can automatically position your fleet in the optimal shelter position - you just need to set a course.

Your fleet's scanners pick up the faintest of comm pings from the object. A closer inspection is necessary to pick apart the fragmented data.",,,

MPC_magnetarWormholeProbe,CUSTOM,"While at first glance this probe appears to be like any other generic sensor probe, deeper scans show internal modifications, as well as strange angular protrusions on its exterior.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_omegaDerelict_probe,CUSTOM,"An example of one of the countless thousands of robot probe ships sent out into the galaxy by the Domain to find new resources to exploit, planets to colonize, and explore the unknown. Some variants are produced by automated motherships. This specimen appears to be inactive; pitted by small impacts, its hull displays iridescence from fearsome radiation scarring. This probe's manufacture could well date to a thousand cycles ago.

This one has had extensive modifications done to it, including shielding against the nearby magnetar.",,,
MPC_omegaDerelict_survey_ship,CUSTOM,"An automated survey ship from a long-past wave of Domain exploration. Thousands of ships like this were sent in waves, some independent, others attached to (or manufactured by) similarly automated motherships following the first wave of robot probes. This apparently unresponsive hulk has been ravaged by centuries of exposure to charged particles and high velocity impacts from interstellar dust.

This one has had extensive modifications done to it, including shielding against the nearby magnetar.",,,
MPC_omegaDerelict_mothership,CUSTOM,"One of the legendary survey motherships, the quiet automated workhorse of the Domain exploration and colonization effort.

MPC_corrupted_weapons_cache,CUSTOM,These drifting cargo pods give peculiar readings unique to spacecraft armaments. They seem to be shielded against the magnetic field and ionic pulses of the nearby magnetar.,,,
MPC_corrupted_supply_cache,CUSTOM,"A cache of supplies, weapons, or other equipment. There are clear signs of prior activity and modification, and they seem to be shielded against the magnetic field and ionic pulses of the nearby magnetar.",,,
MPC_magnetarOmegaCache,CUSTOM,"A strange collection of eggshell-colored angular cargo pods, not unlike a certain foe you've previously faced. They seem to be shielded against the magnetic field and ionic pulses of the nearby magnetar.",,,
,,,,,
MPC_station_researchMagnetarOne,CUSTOM,"A strange research station of domain make, your ship's computer automatically designates it as ""2HHBID"", sending your bridge crew into a confused frenzy, searching for whatever database it drew from.

Unlike the other structures of the system, it is neither constructed to exploratorium standards nor (as far as your sensors can tell) modified to the eggshell standard of everything else. Worryingly, your sensors still pick up power fluctuations within the core, meaning it may still be active.

MPC_slavedOmegaCore,RESOURCE,"This AI core matches no known specifications, rendering it one-of-a-kind. It seems to speak in arcane riddles, disjointed sentences, unable to properly communicate with a human. However, it's processing capacity far exceeds even that of the terrifying alpha-level AI. Whatever this thing is, it's exceptionally powerful, and as a result, incredibly dangerous.",,,
