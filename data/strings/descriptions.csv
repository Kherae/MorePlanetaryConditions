niko_MPC_defenseSatellite,CUSTOM,"A domain-era derelict anti-asteroid satellite, presumably placed in orbit to defend against stellar debris from falling onto the planet below.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteBarrage,TERRAIN,"An array of defense satellites constantly watch over this area, showering anything they deem a threat with a hail of long-ranged artillery.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteCore,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

When exploratorium drones discover a planet, they often perform rudimentary terraforming to better increase it's chances of becoming a viable planet for the ever-growing domain. One such terraform is to prevent any space debris from falling down to earth, and these satellites are one such way of doing it. Armed to the teeth with anti-asteroid, anti-scrap, and, some may argue, anti-ship weaponry, these quite intimidating orbital bastions dominate the orbit of whatever planet they orbit, preventing any unidentified and unauthorized matter from erronously entering their sphere of influence. 

Between those that were aware of the existance of these satellite prior to the collapse, there was often a hushed whisper and quiet idea that these satellites were built for more than just point-defense duty, rationalizing this obvious nonsense - at least, that's what domain ComSec portrayed it as - with the unusual amount of heavy weaponry and layered armor for something of it's nature.
Between those that are aware of their existance now - There is a very common agreement that these things are terribly annoying, intimidating, and lucrative to control.",,,

MPC_superheavyDamper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"An ancient design of the damper field that was discontinued due to the fact that it was extremely inefficient and had to shut down engines to prevent interference. 

Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",Defensive,"Very briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage by 90% at the cost of disabling engines, generating a significant amount of flux, and halving the fire rate of all weapons.",

MPC_realspaceHyperspace_deep,TERRAIN,"This volume of hyperspace is particularly chaotic, hindering the performance of even hyperspace-calibrated equipment.",,,
MPC_realspaceHyperspace_storm,TERRAIN,"This volume of hyperspace is undergoing chaotic phase shifts leading to wildly fluctuating resonance cascades. Ancient and dire warnings of prolonged exposure to so-called ""hyperspace storms"" have been passed down through generations of spacers.",,,
MPC_magnetic_field_hyper,TERRAIN,"An extremely strong magnetic field which traps high energy charged particles. It's extremely difficult to get any sensor readings on a fleet lurking within, and often impossible, due to the frequency of ion storms.",,,
MPC_mesonField,TERRAIN,"A thick field of meson particles. Due to their signature enhancing nature, it's very easy to get a clear sensor reading on a fleet passing through. The effect is inverted, however, once meson concentration surpasses the Burivil threshold, and instead fleets lurking within find their sensors massively amplified and their own signature hidden.",,,

MPC_coronaResistStation,CUSTOM,"A potentially abandoned research station, built either to study some interesting local phenomenon or to study that which is best kept far, far away from inhabited worlds. Its oddity is immediately noticable - the ionized beam of the nearby pulsar curves around the station as if repelled by an invisible force, and sensor sweeps show clear signs of activity both inside and outside the station.",,,
