Domain-Era Anti-Asteroid Satellites,niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites_derelict,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.defenseSatellite.niko_MPC_derelictAntiAsteroidSatellites,"$market has its orbit dominated by an array of hundreds of thousands of domain-era exploratorium anti-asteroid satellites, presumably placed by survey drones in an attempt to increase terraforming viability. Each one is outfitted with enough weaponry to annihilate a small asteroid field, and enough armor to sustain the impact of their scattered debris. Coincidentally, these characteristics also make them excellent at destroying pre-collapse scavengers and rebels-those whom fleets composed of converted civilian ships with weak shields, unreliable targeting computers, and plentiful missiles. Their effectiveness in the current day is also quite impressive, given how few of these planets are ever explored.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites.png,10
Overgrown Nanoforge,niko_MPC_overgrownNanoforgeCondition,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.overgrownNanoforge.overgrownNanoforgeCondition,"Before the collapse, the Domain kept tabs on all Nanoforges. Being a dangerous (and lucrative) technology, they kept a Domain engineer on site of each Nanoforge, along with (either officially or unofficially) a small projection of force to ensure it's proper use, dictated by them. Each Nanoforge would only produce exactly what the owner (often the government of a caste-world) is supposed to output, and exactly what they need to produce it. Any other usage would have been a slippery slope to a grey goo scenario, as claimed by the Domain COMSEC.

Why this particular one seems to have fulfilled that prophecy is up for debate. Maybe the Domain was right, and it was used improperly, to fill more roles than intended, creating food for a foundry world? Maybe it was the on-hand engineer - desperate for a foothold in the new world, using their knowhow to disable the growth safeties in a way that bypasses the thousands of DRM protections? Or was it done with full knowledge of the consequences in a clear head, done for the sole purpose of destruction? One thing's for sure - This was no accident.

The fact it's still running with nobody around most certainly is, though, as only someone completely insane or mind-bogglingly destructive would willingly induce a grey goo scenario on a planet. Right?",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites.png,10
