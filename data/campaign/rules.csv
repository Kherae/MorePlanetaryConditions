He quickly realizes, no, in fact, you are NOT kidding. ""Wh-really? Y'd... pay for somethin' this old? This... fuckin' *useless*?"" He pauses, before looking over his shoulder and shrugging, smiling gently. ""Well. I guess it ain't that useless. That baryon array back there can protect a fuckin' onslaught from god himself... maybe I could upcharge y' instead? Heh... ain't like I've ever lost a *fight*.""

He grins mischevously before wrly chuckling, and shaking his head, to the ease of your bridge crew. ""Jus' kiddin'. Fuck, I'm jus' happy we're finally gettin' t' leave... I'd PAY y' to take this accursed ARRAY of my hands."" He sighs wistfully and brings up his intercom, announcing the good news to the crew. The delighted comms chatter becomes unbearable, and within seconds, your sensor officer disables the wiretap module, much to your appreciation.

""Well cap'n... can't say it's been a pleasure. But I can't say it *hasn't*. I doubt you'll see us again - after all this time, we've grown kinda tired of bein' pirates. But 'ay - if you ever visit a bar in jangala...""

""*Don't* try to find me. 'cause I'll shoot anyone who tries to tie me to my old life."" He winks. ","0:MPC_coronaResistFleetHaggleTwo:Nod politely and wish them well","where you buy the station"

When you ask your tactical officer for clarification, they report the sudden detonation of all hostile derelicts in the system.

SetShortcut defaultLeave ""ESCAPE""","Your $shipOrFleet takes shelter behind the station, which generously shelters it from the withering hail of pulsed radiation emanating from the pulsar. Both you and your ops chief agree it would be wise to exercise caution, given the strange activity in the system coupled with the extra-and-sub-surface activity present on the station. 

A quick sensor sweep shows startlingly high p-space activity, the endpoints of which show high baryon concentration. It is these points that correspond with the deflection of the pulsar, explaining the anomalous protection. A deeper scan shows something much more worrying: The station is powered, active, and containing organic life, with one particular set of hangars holding a flotilla of combat-ready ships (with the rest seemingly occupied by derelict auto-forges ready to churn out ship after ship after ship). Clearly, someone has occupied this station, and may not be exactly welcoming. If they have detected you or not is unknown, though ELINT systems are on alert.

Before you can give your next order, your tactical officer warns you that approaching the station may trigger a tough hostile encounter, and that you should be ready for combat against what appears to be a capital-heavy fleet of mixed design, with numerous smaller escorts.","1:MPC_coronaResistStationExploreMoveFleetIn:Send a detachment of armed salvors

Apon arrival, and multiple assertions of optimal performance, your sensors suddenly alarm. Shooting your head down to your panel, you read multiple IR and UV spikes near the docking ports - small-arms fire. As if on queue, your ops chief snaps up following their latest SitRep and begins barking commands. ""Ripcord. Kill blocks. Seal. Seal. Affirm. Crack and burn.""

The frantic comms chatter quickly gives way to steady yet shaken reports of massive resistance, including mounted heavy weaponry that nearly burnt a hole in one specific shuttle. Once the shuttles reach halfway from the station to your fleet, your tactical officer alarms as numerous ships emerge from the aforementioned hanger and bear down hard on your fleet, barely giving you time to assume a combat formation.

As if things couldn't get worse, the bridge is suddenly flooded by a white light and you have to squint to make out what happened: The baryonic field seems to have been disabled, beginning the withering hail of ionized particles the pulsar so desperately wants to inflict upon your fleet.","0:MPC_coronaResistStationExploreMoveFleetPrepareForBattle:Prepare for battle",
