command,class,tags,syntax,help
# Command: what the player enters to use your custom command,,,,
# Class: points towards the command's script, which should implement BaseCommand,,,
# Tags: used by the Help command to find specific types of commands. Example tags:,,,,
#  Console - system-level commands such as Help or Status, will work everywhere,,,
#  Campaign/Combat - this command only works in these contexts,,,,
"#  A mod-specific tag - include your mod as a tag so Help can differentiate them! The console mod uses the ""core"" tag", so please don't use that tag in your mod,,,
# Syntax: the syntax pattern for your command. <> denotes a required field," [] an optional one. Ex: ""addcrew <amount> [optionalLevel]""",,,
"# Help: what the player is shown when they enter ""help <command>"". The syntax line will be shown by help as well", so you don't need to include it again.,,,
#,,,,
# The most basic command possible, just to give you a starting point,,,
# Intermediate complexity, runs once,,,
