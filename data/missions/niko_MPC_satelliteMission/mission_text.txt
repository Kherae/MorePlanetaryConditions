It was such a promising haul. We got a tip-off that some rare phase ship was out here - enough incentive for me, at least. Sensors were could for fourteen whole kliks - loaded up our buffalos with scrap and metal, enough to feed us all for another cycle. 'course, was too good to be true.
They caught us on the ground of the planet. Before we could take off the hole in the satellite's orbit was cut by that fucking Skulioda cunt! They didn't even fire at them! They still ain't!

This time, I'm not running away. I'm tired of it. He's been stalkin' us far too long - time we repaid the favor. Lets see if my phase training paid off.
