LOW PRIORITY {

Refactor satellites to follow overgrown nanoforge architecture

}

rework condition code to not use procgen and instead use custom code god please
    important for shit like detecting tags

improve satellite overclock ai, its too eager to attack at close range and too hesitant to use at long

Make the volatile effect print out an intel report detailing damages


HIGH PRIORITY {

Convert the overgrown fleet script to use seededfleetmanager or at least take the despawn code
Convert manipulation intel input to lunalib double input

}
IN PROGRESS 

Finish the nanoforgeeffect refactor
    cachedCategory, namely
    Offload some responsibilities to the source, shit like, applyPositives
        Add conditions to effects to allow them to force the source to stop applying benefits if a deficit is disabled or useless

Generify the basesource creation code and effect creation code in industryhandler and randomizedsource
    Copy pasted, just fuckin slap it somewhere on an object

DONE:::
Figure out why ore is always picked as the supply alteration

Figure out why satellite handelrs are deleting multiple times
    Maybe done by making customentityremovalscript not delete if handler is deleted

Figure out why dialog satellite fleets are being cloned and given modular fleet ai instead of ours
    Just a quirk of vanilla, a dialog plugin is REQUIRED, see campaignplugin

Finish overgrown intel

Improve effects, for some reason alter supply isnt being done with negatives,w eirdly enough

Figure out why growth intel and its handlers are having growing set to false and thus their shit gets added prematurely

Overgrown intel in general needs a refactor, its too rigid
Shit like addstage should be handled on the stage class itself, things just in general need a reordering to be less clumsy

Store pre-generated junk apon generation (Once the market is no longer onlyforplanetarycondition or whatever, that is when
it is "properly" generated. do the shit then)
Store core variables in memory so its consistant across decivs
Migrate vars from industry to memory AGAIN for fuck SAKE
