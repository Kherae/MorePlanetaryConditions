Make the volatile effect print out an intel report detailing damages

Figure out why ore is always picked as the supply alteration

Figure out why satellite handelrs are deleting multiple times
    Maybe done by making customentityremovalscript not delete if handler is deleted

Figure out why dialog satellite fleets are being cloned and given modular fleet ai instead of ours
