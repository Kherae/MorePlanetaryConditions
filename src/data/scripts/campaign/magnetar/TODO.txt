Finish stages
Implement guard fleet
Write dialogue for all contributing factions

Write dialogue for IAIIC
IAIIC faction descs and stuff

Write in contingencies
    What if the planet is taken over? Should have a script that checks and destroys the core

PL Integration/Ways to sabotage it
    Promise diktat weapons and tech in exchange for assistancne
    Strongarm the PL to help you if youre in the PL
    Hire mercenaries?

Idea: Go to participating factions and get them to divest
    If successful, increases progress and erases an event
        Probably should only get rid of the minor raids
        Maybe also decrease strength of the final raid

    Not easy, probably have to do a major task for them
        LC and LP probably will never divest early
            Hegemony?

Need a way to slow down the crisis
    CURRENTLY WAYS YOU CAN DO IT:
        Remove AI cores from planets
            Won't help with the fractal core, which cant be removed
        Be at peace with the IAIIC (get worse accessibility, but attrition increases a lot slower)

    PLANNED WAYS:
        Sue for peace (SP option + maybe some money)
        Bribe IAIIC officials?

Ways to accelerate crisis
    CURRENT WAYS:
        Destroy IAIIC ships
        Cause shortages in the FOB
        Disrupt the FOB
    PLANNED WAYS:
        Raid and disrupt contributor factions(?)

Maybe make it so if the FOB is destroyed, the crisis just ends instantly?
    Can be made REALLY HARD with defense rating + orbital defenses
