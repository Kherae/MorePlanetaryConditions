No contacts reported, no autonomous defenses. Looks like the interior scans were right - this place is completely undefended. With a foothold in the central chamber, your ops chief feels confidant enough to order a general exploration order, relaxing combat protocols. Your salvors collectively sigh with relief (under their breaths, of course) and begin vigorously cataloguing their finds.

The chamber itself appears to be some kind of... manufactorum? At least, thats what your tactical officer says - with a shrug. Specialized chambers of unknown make dot the walls, with slots for some kind of device behind a chromeglass shield. Conveyor belts shoot out from a central platform, the same kind of slot placed in equidistant 5 foot intervals atop them, and on the platform...

"$PlayerSirOrMadam..." a salvor's voice rings out, "...it's some kind of AI core."
