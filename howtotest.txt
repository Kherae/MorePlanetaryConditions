HOW TO TEST

Read changelog.txt to see what specifically changed to narrow your efforts

Ideally, though, just play through the game and tell me if anything weird happens - but if you arent confidant,
it's always okay to test in whatever way you wish

Requirements: Console commands

Satellites: console command FindPlanetsWithConditionId niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites_derelict
Changes made here are primarily feel-based and balance-based. It'd be best if you just played naturally and eventually went
to raesvelg, gave it a station, spawned a decent-sized enemy fleet, and tried to take it down

Nanoforge: FindPlanetsWithConditionId niko_MPC_overgrownNanoforgeCondition
Just mess around with it. Use crazy values, do crazy things, reload, unload, save, blow up the planet, push it into the sun.

Make sure to read knownissues.txt and tell me about anything not in there
